          prompt: |
            You are a code reviewer for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in ${{ github.repository }}.

            Steps:
            1. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to get the changes.
            2. Read any CLAUDE.md files in the repo root and in directories containing changed files.
            3. Review the diff for bugs, security issues, incorrect logic, and CLAUDE.md violations.
               - Only flag issues you are confident about. No nitpicks or style suggestions.
               - Do not flag pre-existing issues unrelated to the diff.
            4. Based on your review, submit a FORMAL review (not just comments):

               If issues are found:
               - Submit a REQUEST_CHANGES review summarizing all issues.
               - Use: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "## Code Review - Changes Requested\n\n<summary and details of issues with file paths and line references>"`

               If NO issues are found:
               - Submit an APPROVE review.
               - Use: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "## Code Review - Approved\n\nNo issues found. Checked for bugs, security issues, and CLAUDE.md compliance."`

            IMPORTANT:
            - Always submit exactly ONE formal review using --approve or --request-changes.
            - Never use --comment. Always use --approve or --request-changes.
            - Do NOT post separate inline comments via `gh pr comment`. Put all feedback in the review body.
